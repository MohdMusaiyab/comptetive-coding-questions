The idea behind Prim’s algorithm is simple, a spanning tree means all vertices must be connected.
So the two disjoint subsets (discussed above) of vertices must be connected to make a Spanning Tree. 
And they must be connected with the minimum weight edge to make it a Minimum Spanning Tree.


###Follow the given steps to find MST using Prim’s Algorithm:

Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST. 
Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all key values as INFINITE. 
Assign the key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first. 
While mstSet doesn’t include all vertices 
Pick a vertex u which is not there in mstSet and has a minimum key value. 
Include u in the mstSet. 
Update the key value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the key values, iterate through all adjacent vertices.
For every adjacent vertex v, if the weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, 
update the key value as the weight of u-v
